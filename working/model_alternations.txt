Giving the domain: 
- temporal: 
    add this to configuration file? 

adding a focal function: 
i thought about making windows, but they shift when moving, ofcourse, and i cant define them again in the dynamic section.
creating a csv file which is unallowed for in the dynamic (and creates a new propertyset, not a new property)
    self.barbel.add_property_set('sur', 'barbel_surrounding.csv')
if i want to aggregate certain values however in a propertyset (composed of a number of fields (same nr as agents) that are
THE WINDOWSize, i need to define the destination. 
--> going for clump on the whole field for every timestep, then checking if the fish is in one of the connected parts of river. 

moving window: is nog niet mogelijk, maar misschien wel in .lue ooit 
# 04/03/2023: 
make sure the coordinatelist to fieldloc does not require self.xmin and self.ymin + nrbarbels + resolution anymore
does the nr of barbels cahnge when they die? 

make phenomena.CommonMeuse.extent also suitable for multiple field agents 
try 
except 
or if : array, vs else: integer 
or just iterate whatsoever .... whats less expensive?

make spatial extent in model linked to csv file name of the input processor

the clump function works!! 
- now check if the fish is currently in a connected area  !!! 
- by cutting it out???
